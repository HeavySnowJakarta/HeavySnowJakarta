# About me

坱兮轧 山曲岪 心淹留兮恫慌忽 罔兮沕 憭兮栗 虎豹穴 丛薄深林兮人上栗

I've started learning programming since the first year of middle school after being interested in it for years. Now I'm studying computer science in an university and enjoy knowing more exciting technologies about tools building fast and robust apps, AI models and automation workflows.

## Skills

* **Front-end development**: Interned at [Deamoy AI](https://deamoy.ai/) and having experience of developing React apps.
* **Flutter development**: Developing a pre-open-source Flutter app, planned for both mobile and desktop with i18n features and great extendability.

## Interests

* Amateur radio: Interested in both UV and short wave contacting (especially contacting during travels and DXing). Still practicing CW...
* Music: Ever been learning pop piano for 2 years. Practicing DJ mixxing for now.
